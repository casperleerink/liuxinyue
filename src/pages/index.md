The **photos** used in this project were given to me for free from a thrift store.

What struck me as particular was the meticulously handwritten text on the back of the photos, indicating the time and place from which they were taken. Thanks to all the information provided on the back, me and my collaborator, Casper Leerink were able to revisit all the place, some 20 years later.

As newcomers to the city, we were amazed by the idea of being able to witness the drastic changes that have taken place in the city of Vancouver through the eyes of its dweller. It only occurred to us later in the project to research into the photographer: Rod Logan. Turns out, he was not an anonymous nobody whose works have never been discovered. His amazing collection of ships had even had its own exhibition at the Polygon Gallery, an exhibition that I even once visited myself.

We couldn't get in touch with him, but if we ever cross path in the future, please know that we are so thankful for your photographs, Mr.Logan.

Gonging back to our project, we visited 7 places in total around Vancouver, collecting videos and soundscapes at each location. We then put the photos in a book where the audience can interact with these places from turning to different pages. The emergence of the audiovisual elements is in sync with the positions of the respective photographs in the book. The encounter ceases to exist each time a page is turned.

This work is showed under a group multimodal installation titled *Experiments in Art and Ethnography*, as part of *Changing Climates*, the 2019 Canadian Anthropology Society and American Anthropological Association conference.
