*Fixing My Leave* thinks through what it means to identify with a fallen leaf. 

I use archival footage to thread together three female figures—Daiyu Lin, Lulu Miller, and Yoko Ono—as a way of caring for a leaf that loses its tree.

The film is created as part of the ‘[Response: Soft Action](https://thepolygon.ca/exhibition/response-soft-action/)’ program hosted by the Polygon Gallery. The workshop series “considers care and its relationship to action” by responding to Indigenous filmmakers’ prompts in the form of moving images. *Fixing My Leave* reflects the fruit of my thinking there—kinship-based, intimate, and comforting grief through storytelling.
