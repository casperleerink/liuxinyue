The Hug is a contemporary dance performance inspired by an embrace the choreographer, Tomoyo Yamada had with a specific U.S. veteran in 2015. This experience led to creating a performative poem, which was shared digitally through The Dance Cafe (The Response, 2020) and performed live with projection and movement at the 2021 Vancouver Outsider Arts Festival. The poem aims to highlight the difficult healing process and reconcile with the aftermath of war that continues to haunt the Asian communities today.
