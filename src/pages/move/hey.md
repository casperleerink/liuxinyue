*Found/Unfounded* is a performative collaboration between Xinyue Liu and sound artist Joey Zaurrini. Together, Liu and Zaurrini embarked on a journey to investigate the notion of "Thing Power" brought forth by Jane Bennett in her writing, *In a Poticial Ecology of Things*. In gathering and rearranging objects collected from unexpected places, the artists yielded space for nonhuman objects and allowed them to animate the contingency of the human-nonhuman relationship.
