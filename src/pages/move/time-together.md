*Time, together* is part of *seams*, a first-year Master of Fine Arts students Spring Show in the School for the Contemporary Arts, Simon Fraser University.

*Time, together* deals with the fading of a memory. As lived experience dims with time, its associated materials may nonetheless remain. Through a digital gaze, these photographs continue to live as things and to hold memories in place.

Exhibition:

May 02-11, Audain Gallery, SFU Goldcorp Centre for the Arts.
