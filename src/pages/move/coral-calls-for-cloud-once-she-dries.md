*Once She Dries* is a five-projection collaborative installation that tracks the perilous journey of Coral, a non-human protagonist who must navigate the volatility of her ocean and sky in a devastatingly unstable Anthropocentric age. The piece unfolds through a cyclical performance of pre-recorded spoken text, song, and video triptychs.

The story is based on a scientific phenomenon: when corals begin drying up due to climate change, their ability to release a pheromone-like bio-chemical which triggers cooling cloud formations decreases. Over time, corals become unable to attract a cloud overhead.
