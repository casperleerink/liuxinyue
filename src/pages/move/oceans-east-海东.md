This multimedia installation is based on a fictional memory of my father from when I was little.

He was a soldier on a submarine, he was constantly traveling from one city to another, he was once ambitious, he was addicted to drinking, he was loving but ill-tempered...he was a silhouette caught between my amnesia and imagination.

I looked through found 35mm slides gathered from flea market to try to find figures which resembled him. I then took slide photos of a girl sitting in an empty room. By juxtaposing past with present, a narrative came to me. Which parts are true and which parts false? I assume only he would find out.
