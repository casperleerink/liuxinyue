V Gift is a video installation piece using projection mapping on objects. It tells an intimate, ambiguous story which takes place in an open suitcase.



How to make objects talk? How to make them talk without really saying how they feel? I was inspired by a conversation between Issa Samb and Antje Majewski:

"The more the object passes from hand to hand, the less it will be charged and more it will discharge."

"To consider the object in and of itself...to grant it another energy charge over/above a superficial one, or one that a machine may have given it."

"The object will carry meaning with it, the history of this country, the history of the men of this country, the women of this country, the history of the birds that will migrate soon and perhaps take the same trajectory they took either before or after the objects arrived."



I was also reminded by the girl who dragged her suitcase from one country to another just so she could be in the arms of her lover. The objects talk to her very frequently and easily. For they have traveled thousands of miles with her. In her suitcase, she once packed in all of her anticipation, ambition, longing, yearning, desire, dream, fantasy and fiction. All of which now faded and decayed.

But time is stealthy in this suitcase. It surfaces occasionally, only to probe her memories and kindle the words, said or unsaid between them. She feels the need to put the memories in her palms, look at them in the eyes, and to say: "I still remember."
