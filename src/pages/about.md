Xinyue Liu is a visual artist who works primarily with video, photography, text, and fabrics. By incorporating fragmented narratives and outdated visuals, Liuâ€™s practice probes the manifestations of displacement, intimacy, and unfinished stories. She is fascinated by the renegotiations of past and present that unfold when she searches for and handles found objects, lost images and readymade knickknacks.

Liu received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Television and Radio Production from Jilin University, China before moving to Vancouver. The culmination of her upbringing and her new-found experiences has led her to a research-based practice which unravels through the study of expanded cinema and the politics of nostalgia.
